# CWDLauncher
Launch a program in a given working directory.
This is meant for a kid with some tech expertise
to give to their parent with a custom config.ini
file.

## config.ini
The config file follows the standard ini format. <br/>
For each entry you need to give it a header. The header
will become the name of the entry. You also need a `command`
entry which will become the program run. After that
use `arg1`, `arg2`, etc. to supply the program arguments.


You could also accomplish this with a shortcut but where's
the fun in that?
